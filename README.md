Oculus Rift Stereo Cam
==

A live preview of this application can be viewed [**here**][preview].

This application is a proof of concept which allows you to feed two local webcams into your face. I got the idea to build this after reading [**this**][xkcd] web comic.

Further versions may include the ability to feed two remote cameras into your face. We'll see.
